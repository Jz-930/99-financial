The underlying policy remains a stable, long-term asset designed for conservative growth."},{question:"Can I access cash value without using an IFA?",answer:"Yes. The corporation may use policy loans, withdrawals, or bank collateral loans without a formal IFA arrangement."},{question:"Are interest payments always tax-deductible?",answer:"No. Deductibility depends on how borrowed funds are used. They must be tied to income-producing activities and should be confirmed with your tax advisor."},{question:"When does the CDA credit become available?",answer:"Only upon the insured's passing. This is when the corporation can distribute tax-free capital dividends to shareholders, subject to proper elections and CRA filing."},{question:"Are participating life insurance returns guaranteed?",answer:"Policies include guaranteed values, but dividends are not guaranteed. However, Canadian insurers generally have strong, stable long-term dividend histories."},{question:"Can my corporation own and pay for the insurance?",answer:"Yes. This is the standard and often most tax-efficient structure for business owners with retained earnings."},{question:"Does the bank review my corporate financials for an IFA?",answer:"Yes. Standard underwriting includes reviewing financial statements, tax returns, and corporate banking history."},{question:"Can I change beneficiaries or ownership later?",answer:"Yes. Corporate-owned policies offer flexibility through restructuring, buy-sell agreements, or estate planning adjustments. Any changes should be coordinated with your legal and tax advisors."}];function r(){let[e,r]=(0,t.useState)(0);return(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:"space-y-4",children:s.map((t,s)=>(0,n.jsxs)(a.default,{className:`bg-white p-8 rounded-lg shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition cursor-pointer border border-slate-100 ${e===s?"open":""}`,delay:50*s,children:[(0,n.jsxs)("div",{className:"flex justify-between font-bold text-brand-blue list-none items-center text-lg",onClick:()=>{r(e===s?null:s)},children:[(0,n.jsx)("span",{children:t.question}),(0,n.jsx)("span",{className:`transition-transform duration-300 text-brand-gold ml-4 flex-shrink-0 ${e===s?"rotate-180":""}`,children:(0,n.jsx)("i",{className:"fa-solid fa-chevron-down"})})]}),(0,n.jsx)("div",{className:`overflow-hidden transition-all duration-500 ease-in-out ${e===s?"max-h-96 opacity-100 mt-6 pt-6 border-t border-slate-100":"max-h-0 opacity-0"}`,children:(0,n.jsx)("p",{className:"text-slate-600 leading-relaxed",children:t.answer})})]},s))})}e.s(["default",()=>r])}]);
