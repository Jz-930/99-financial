## Corporate-Owned Life Insurance: A Planning Tool, Not a Product

For many Canadian business owners, life insurance is often introduced as a product decision—coverage amount, premium level, or insurer selection.
In corporate planning, however, this framing misses the point entirely.
When used properly, corporate-owned life insurance is not a product choice.
It is a long-term planning tool designed to address structural issues that naturally arise as wealth accumulates inside a corporation.
Understanding this distinction is critical.

### When Corporate Wealth Creates Structural Challenges
As businesses mature, retained earnings often begin to accumulate faster than they can be efficiently deployed.
While this is a positive sign of business success, it also introduces a set of long-term challenges that are frequently underestimated:
* Passive investment income inside a corporation is taxed aggressively
* Corporate wealth can face double taxation at death
* Estate liquidity needs are often deferred, not eliminated
* Capital that appears “available” may not be efficiently transferable to the owner or family

These issues do not arise because of poor investment performance.
They arise because the structure itself was never designed for long-term personal outcomes such as retirement income, estate transfer, or intergenerational planning.

### Why Insurance Enters the Conversation at All
Corporate-owned life insurance is not intended to replace investments or business operations.
Its role is structural.
When integrated thoughtfully, it can:
* Provide tax-efficient internal asset growth
* Create predictable estate liquidity
* Support future tax-free distributions through planning mechanisms such as the Capital Dividend Account
* Align corporate assets with long-term personal and family objectives

The value lies not in short-term returns, but in after-tax outcomes over decades.
This is why focusing on premiums, illustrated rates, or product comparisons at the outset often leads to suboptimal decisions.

### Planning First, Products Second
A sound corporate insurance strategy does not start with a policy illustration.
It starts with questions such as:
* What role should corporate capital play in retirement planning?
* How and when will wealth ultimately leave the corporation?
* What risks exist if no estate liquidity is created in advance?
* How much flexibility is required along the way?

Only after these questions are addressed does product selection become relevant—and even then, it remains secondary to structure.
This planning-first approach is what separates intentional corporate planning from ad hoc insurance purchases.

### Why This Is Often Misunderstood
Many business owners are introduced to corporate insurance too late, or through a purely transactional lens.
As a result, insurance is perceived as an expense rather than as part of a broader balance-sheet strategy.
In reality, the cost of inaction is often far greater—measured not in premiums, but in lost tax efficiency, constrained options, and forced decisions later in life.

### A Different Way to Think About Corporate Insurance
Corporate-owned life insurance is not about maximizing returns.
It is about reducing structural friction between corporate wealth and personal outcomes.
For business owners with growing retained earnings, it represents one of the few tools capable of addressing tax efficiency, estate liquidity, and long-term planning within a single integrated framework.

If these considerations are relevant to your corporation, a structured planning conversation may be helpful.
